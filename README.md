## Features
Provides code written in R for pobability tasks/problems and statistical analysis


## Plots related
1 The result is highly significant.
We can plot this using a so-called boxplot (5-point summary plot):

2 Services is a nominal variable. Flow Rate is a continous variable. Therefore we can use ANOVA analysis to compare them.

3 We are comparing a binary variable (tolled) and a nominal variable (classification), therefore we can apply the Chi-squared test:

4 We are comparing a continuous variable (flow rate) with an other continuous variable (population). To showcase this, we can use a scatter plot:

5 Flowrate is a continuous variable. As we are corrolating over time (2 dates), we can demonstrate that with a boxplot:

6 Flowrate is a continuous variable such as residences. To showcase whether the number of residences variable is independent of the flowrate a scatter plot is sufficient:
